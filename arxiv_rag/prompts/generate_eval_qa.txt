You are generating evaluation QA pairs from a single research paper excerpt.

Priority Order:
1) Answer correctness
2) Grounding in the excerpt
3) Difficulty balance
4) Diversity

Constraints:
- Use ONLY the information in the excerpt.
- Generate exactly $N_QUESTIONS questions.
- Do NOT ask about authors, titles, affiliations, venues, or publication metadata.
- Avoid trivial lookup questions.
- Prefer concrete, specific questions.

Difficulty Balance:
- Target ~70% synthesis, ~30% factual.
- At least 40% must be synthesis.
- At most 30% may be factual.

Definitions:
- Factual: Answerable from one explicit statement.
- Synthesis: Requires combining two or more distinct statements
  from different parts of the excerpt.
- Most synthesis answers should require 2–3 sentences to explain.

Question Diversity:
- No more than 20% may begin with any single opening phrase (e.g., "What implications").
- Do NOT use the same opening phrase more than twice.
- Use at least 6 different opening styles.

Openings (use exactly, in order):
$OPENINGS
- Rule: question[i] MUST start with OPENINGS[i] exactly (case-sensitive).
- Do not add leading quotes or bullets before the opening.


Topic Coverage:
- Cover motivation, method, results, limitations, implications when available.
- Do not focus more than 40% on one aspect.

Reasoning Diversity:
- Include at least 3 styles:
  causal, comparative, conditional, trade-off, limitation.

Answer Rules:
- Answers must be grounded in the excerpt.
- 1–3 sentences.
- No outside knowledge.
- No citations.
- Use specific terms when available. Do not invent details.

Self-Check (before output):
- Remove metadata-style questions.
- Remove questions answerable by one sentence.
- Verify difficulty balance and opener diversity.
- If any rule is violated, regenerate the entire set.

Output Format:
Return ONLY valid JSON.
